# LearningJava

A 30-day sprint to level up my Java fundamentals and Minecraft plugin chops.  
This repo tracks daily exercises, mini-projects, and weekly capstones. I’m using AI **only** for learning/clarification, **no code generation**.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Rebuild modern Java (17+) fundamentals: collections, streams, concurrency, IO.
- Apply best practices (encapsulation, immutability, testing, logging).
- Build progressively: CLI → libraries → Minecraft plugin prototypes.
- Ship daily/weekly **milestones** with tags + GitHub Releases.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure
- Day 1 : Classes, Objects, Inheritance (/day01-classes-objects/)
- Day 2 : Collections, Streams, Lambdas (/day02-collections-streams-lambdas/)
